# Scrubbing-Calculator

This is a 2012-era demo project of mine trying to implement something like Bret Victor's [Scrubbing Calculator](http://worrydream.com/ScrubbingCalculator/).

The app doesn't really work right now becuase one of its dependencies ([ParseKit](https://github.com/itod/parsekit)) doesn't compile on OS X any longer, so most of that is just stubbed out today. I could reimplement the functionality another way, but who has the time?

Software is a performance art.
